📦 Snowflake Internal Stages:
Snowflake provides internal stages as managed cloud storage to help you stage data files before loading them into tables. 
Internal stages are fully managed by Snowflake and are available across AWS, Azure, or GCP depending on your Snowflake account.

✅ Types of Internal Stages

1. User Stage (@~)
Each user is automatically assigned a stage.
Best for temporary personal staging of files.
Files in this stage cannot be shared with other users.
Cannot be altered or dropped.

-- Upload file to user stage
PUT file://C:\Users\janar\OneDrive\Documents\Files\pets_data.json @~/staged;

-- List files in user stage
LIST @~/staged;

2. Table Stage (@%<table_name>)
Implicit stage tied to each table.
Used to stage files that will be loaded into that specific table.
Cannot be altered or dropped.
Not a separate database object.

-- Create a table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydb.public.customer_data_table (
  customerid NUMBER,
  custname STRING,
  email STRING,
  city STRING,
  state STRING,
  DOB DATE
);

-- Upload file to the table's stage
PUT file://C:\Users\janar\OneDrive\Documents\Files\customer_data_table.csv @%customer_data_table;

-- List files in table stage
LIST @%customer_data_table;


3. Named Stage (@<stage_name>)
Explicitly created using CREATE STAGE.
Usable by multiple users and tables.
Managed like any other database object.
Can be used similarly to external stages (but stored internally).

-- Create named internal stages
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE mydb.internal_stages.named_customer_stage;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE mydb.internal_stages.named_orders_stage;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE mydb.internal_stages.named_product_stage;

-- Show all named stages in a schema
SHOW STAGES IN mydb.internal_stages;

-- Upload file to a named stage
PUT file://C:\path\to\file.csv @mydb.internal_stages.named_customer_stage;

-- List files in named stage
LIST @mydb.internal_stages.named_customer_stage;

Notes: 
PUT works only from SnowSQL or Snowflake Web UI, not from the worksheet editor alone.
Use internal stages for secure, fast staging when you're not using external cloud storage like S3, GCS, or Azure Blob.
